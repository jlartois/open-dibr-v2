# OpenDIBR V2

This repository contains a framework based on [OpenDIBR](https://github.com/IDLabMedia/open-dibr). 

Currently, this repository is still under construction (until after the holidays, my apologies).

Download the example dataset [here](https://cloud.ilabt.imec.be/index.php/s/iC4FoMrC9KGW8Ek) and put the files in the `dataset` folder. It contains 4 videos from the Interdigital Painter dataset.
